# Take My Review

Take My Review is a small React app that lets users add, edit, update, and delete reviews.  
I built this project to practice core React concepts like state management, conditional rendering, and component structure.

## Features
- Add a review
- Edit and update reviews
- Delete reviews
- Simple and clean UI
- Fast performance

## Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Vite

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run the app locally:

npm install  
npm run dev  

The app will start on:
http://localhost:5173

## Future Improvements
- Rating system
- Save reviews using localStorage or backend
- Better UI and animations
